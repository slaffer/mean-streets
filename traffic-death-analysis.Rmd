## Load R packages and the data

```{r}

# load packages; note: if your machine doesn't have these 
# packages installed yet, you can install many of them all at
# once with install.packages("tidyverse").  See also:
# https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

# will need to install this separately; not included in tidyverse
library(RColorBrewer)

# read data in from traffic-deaths.csv, store in a data frame called "df.traffic"
# note that we do not create factors from the strings; we may want factors later,
# but it's often easier to do it ourselves

df.traffic <- read.csv('traffic-deaths.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Process/clean the data

```{r}
# process victim_type to convert spaces and empty cells to "unknown"

df.traffic$victim_type <- ifelse(df.traffic$victim_type == " ", "unknown", df.traffic$victim_type)

df.traffic$victim_type <- ifelse(df.traffic$victim_type == "", "unknown", df.traffic$victim_type)

# turn victim_type into a factor, and order the categories by how many accidents
# occurred in each category. "table" counts the accidents in each category,
# "sort" reorders the categories, and "names" takes just the category
# names and discards the counts

df.traffic$victim_type <- factor(df.traffic$victim_type, levels=names(sort(table(df.traffic$victim_type))))


# create a continuous timestamp variable, rather than 
# two string columns that store date and time separately

# first, paste the two columns together with a space in between, then use 
# lubridate to read the date and time information; this produces an
# error on rows where either of the columns is empty

df.traffic$timestamp <- mdy_hm(paste(df.traffic$date," ",df.traffic$time), tz="America/New_York")

# an alternative way to do this, without using lubridate

#df.traffic$timestamp <- strptime(paste(df.traffic$date," ",df.traffic$time), "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p", tz="America/New_York")


# create a second data frame that removes all rows without a full timestamp;
# this is what we'll use for the analysis

df.fulldate <- subset(df.traffic, !is.na(timestamp))
```

## Visualizing variable separately for a quick summary

### Accidents over time

```{r accidents_by_month}

# In this plot, we want to summarize the data by month. The bar chart
# will count the number of accidents in each month; we just have to
# tell it how to find the month in the data.  It's easy to pull parts 
# of the timestamp out using lubridate functions like month(). 
# Type ?lubridate for information.

ggplot(df.fulldate, aes(x=month(timestamp, label=TRUE))) + geom_bar()

```

```{r accidents_by_hour}

# This is similar to the previous plot, but now we're pulling out the
# hour of the timestamp.  What do you think factor() is doing here?
# Tip: try the same plot without the factor() command.

ggplot(df.fulldate, aes(x=factor(hour(timestamp)))) + geom_bar()

```

```{r accidents_by_day}

# Try on your own: plot the number of accidents on different days of the week.

```

### Categories of victims

```{r age_distribution}

# In previous plots, we used "geom_bar".  This chart is using "geom_histogram".
# Why might that be?

ggplot(df.fulldate, aes(x=age)) + geom_histogram(bins=25)

```

```{r victims_by_gender}

# Here is the basic framework for a pie chart, but it could use a lot of help!  
# For starters, try:
#    - fixing the categories to change blank cells to "Unknown"
#    - combine "M" and "m"
#    - specify the order of the wedges in pie chart

ggplot(df.fulldate, aes(x=factor(1),fill=gender)) + geom_bar(position="stack") + coord_polar(theta="y") 

```

## Looking for relationships between variables

```{r victims_by_hour}

# This is the same plot by hour we had above, but now the bars are colored
# according to the victim type.  The final line of the plot overrides the 
# default colors using part of a color palette from the RColorBrewer package.

ggplot(df.fulldate, aes(x=factor(hour(timestamp)))) + geom_bar(aes(fill=victim_type)) + scale_fill_manual(values=rev(brewer.pal(5,"Set2")))
```

```{r hour_by_dayofweek}

# This plot is often called a "heatmap". It compares the day of the week to the 
# hour of the day to see if there are cycles of accidents.  In ggplot2, heatmaps
# are called bin2d, or a chart with two dimensional binning.  This plot also
# using "theme_bw()" to apply a black and white background theme, instead of the
# grey background with white gridlines.

ggplot(df.fulldate, aes(x=hour(timestamp), y=wday(timestamp, label=TRUE))) + 
  geom_bin2d(binwidth=1) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low="mistyrose",high="indianred4") + 
  theme_bw()

```

```{r accidents_by_day_a}

# What about a line chart that shows the number of accidents each day for the 
# entire year?  Well, it's a bit messy, but here's one way you might make that.

ggplot(df.fulldate, aes(timestamp)) + geom_freqpoly(binwidth=86400)
```

```{r accidents_by_day_b}

# Here's another way to make pretty much the same chart.  What are the differences?

ggplot(df.fulldate, aes(yday(timestamp))) + geom_freqpoly(binwidth=1)

```

```{r charges_by_victim}

# Now, what if we wanted to try to predict whether charges would be filed?
# This code does a few things:
#    - limit the data just to rows where "charges" is not empty
#    - create one bar for adult victims, one for child victims
#    - split the bar into two categories -- one where charges is "None", and 
#      another that includes everything else
#    - have the bars measure percentage instead of count

ggplot(df.fulldate[df.fulldate$charges != "",], aes(x=child_adult,fill=charges!="None")) + geom_bar(position="fill")

```
